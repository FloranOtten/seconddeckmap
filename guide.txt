Create the new z-level and link the station level to the new z-level by executing this SDQL2 query:
CALL add_new_zlevel("Deck 2", ['Station':1,'Down':-11,'Baseturf':/turf/open/openspace]) ON /datum/controller/subsystem/mapping; UPDATE /datum/space_level WHERE z_value == 2 SET traits = ["Linkage": "Cross", "Station":1, "Up":11]

Then upload the map as a template with the following verb:
Map-Template---Upload

Jump to the following coordinates with the following verb:
Jump-to-Coordinate 112 123 13

And place the map template with the following verb, the map template is always at the end of the list:
Map-template---Place

Now locate the multi-deck power adapter, it is north and above of the atmos incinerator.
Place a copy of it under the one on top and call find_relays and refresh on the TOP one

Now you can put stairs on the BOTTOM z-level, basically you just have to have openspace above it and an open turf in front of it above it.
